This folder contains graphs generated by GRAN. The folders (25-percent, 33-percent, etc.) contain graphs generated at
a certain fraction (percentage) of total epochs based on the hyperparameters in the GRAN repo. These files were used in the GGM
evaluation experiments. The .h5 files outside of these folders are 100-percent trained, and used for the mixing generated experiment.
